Hey there! Thanks for downloading my TU Pianer Sheet Music pack! This was made for use with the TU Pianer in Tower Unite. These can easily be adapted for other players as needed. Credit for many of these songs go to Kite, Mawfeen, Shiyro, and to all other contributors that I have missed. Thank you all for posting these songs, this pack couldn't have happened without all of you!

Not all songs are perfectly labeled, with some missing authors. And some songs might not play perfect. I was not able to check all 750 songs, but can confirm at least 700 are working perfectly.

You are welcome to use and distribute this as needed. Please give me credit if you spread it around though. :)

Happy piano playing, and enjoy!


Cheers,

Omnipotent
